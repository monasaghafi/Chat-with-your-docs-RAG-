## NLP Text Generation and Question Answering  

This repository showcases the configuration of a language model for text generation and embedding extraction using Hugging Face transformers. It employs Mistral for text generation and RAG for context-based question answering.  

### Overview:  
- Text generation with Mistral model  
- Embedding extraction with MiniLM model  
- RAG for context-based question answering  

### Usage:  
1. Configure Mistral model for text generation  
2. Extract embeddings using MiniLM model  
3. Apply RAG for question answering based on context  
4. Experiment with different prompts and context scenarios for question answering tasks.  

Explore the code for advanced natural language processing tasks and enhance question answering capabilities.
